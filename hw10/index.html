        <p class="chapter__text">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
          and<br> the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs<br> APIs 
          as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:<em>bundles of reusable, nestable
          code.</em> You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover<br> how components work in React 
          Native.

        </div>
        <p class="chapter__text">React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with<br>
          JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get<br> 
          you started or can serve as a refresher course.
        </p>
        <p class="chapter__text">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
        <p class="chapter__text "><b>+ components</b>. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,<br> 
          approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
        </p>
        <p class="chapter__text"><b>+ JSX</b>. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:<br>
          <span>&#60;Text&#62;Hello, I am your cat!&#60;/Text&#62;</span>.</p>
        <p class="chapter__text">The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is<br>
          JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span>name</span> for the cat, name, and<br> 
          embedding it with curly braces inside <span>&#60;Text&#62;</span></p>
        <p class="chapter__text"><b>+ props</b>. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
        <p class="chapter__text"><b>+ state</b>. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, <br>
          state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over <br>
          time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

          <h2 class="chapter__title">handling text input</h2>
          <span class="chapter__subtitle"><sup>Chapter 4</sup></span>
        </div>
        <p class="chapter__text">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <i>onChangeText</i> prop that<br>
           takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a<br>
           function to be called when the text is submitted.
        </p>
        <p class="chapter__text">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language.<br> 
          In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there <br>
          Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
